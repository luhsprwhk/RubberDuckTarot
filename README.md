## Meet Rob Chen ðŸ‘»

Rob Chen (1999-2023) was a full-stack developer who survived Y2K, the dot-com crash, and countless framework wars before meeting his end while avoiding a startup pitch for "AI-powered pet nutrition." Now trapped in a rubber duck, he provides brutally honest but genuinely helpful life advice through modernized tarot readings, combining decades of technical experience with the perspective of someone who's literally seen it all.
